# GetMeCoffee

The purpose of the study is to understand how people perceive, create, and accept real- world tasks (for others) on a mobile phone.

Participants are able to create/select a task (order coffee) on GetMeCoffee application. The task will then be offered (or pushed) to one or more participants in the system. The goal of the system, then, is to generate dynamics in which the tasks are most likely to be accepted and completed by participants.
